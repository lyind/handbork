# Ground Rule

You are generally expected to be reachable for emergencies during your P32 day.
This has been established in the [first ground rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ws05-gb5SESuwaAKI9gQipGmPjUoVxs_KZqEREjZcVk) of P32 and is your duty to ensure.

> Everyone needs to make sure that their phone number in Personio is correct and reachable!

# Reaching Engineers

Engineers are available through [opsgenie](https://giantswarm.app.opsgenie.com/alert/list).
Reaching out can easily done by creating an `alert` through the opsgenie UI and assigning the person you need to contact.

# General Outreach

Everyone is expected to be reachable by phone during their P32 day.
You can find phone numbers in [personio](https://giant-swarm.personio.de/staff) in the public profile.
