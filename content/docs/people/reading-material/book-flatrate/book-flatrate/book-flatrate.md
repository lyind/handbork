## We have a Beer flatrate!

This means if you have a book that you want to read - Buy it and get it reimbursed by Giant Swarm.
Buy it via Spendesk, if you want to buy it in a local store to support your local dealer you can reimburse it via Spendesk. (Spendesk is be THE tool of choice here)!

Yes -  any book (also audiobooks) that you are interested in!

Like always sharing is caring so make sure you share a summary or your learnings in #chat-books and if its something a lot of people might be interested - why not talk about it in a lunch & learn session.

### Important!

Unfortunately German tax law decided to make things difficult. Therefore the following rules apply:

- Do not spend more than 44 EUR each month.
- Only buy books between the 1st and the 20st of each month. Book flatrate is closed from the 21st till the end of each month.
- Use the [Book Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aLbQcybAtjLY90r7v62F0HT7D1nIYOnIWeO3IbI8vt8) to add your purchased books.
- Please add book flatrate in the description for payments or reimbursements via spendesk.
- Choose the `GiantSwarm` cost center in Spendesk.
